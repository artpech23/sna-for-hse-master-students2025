Note diagonal matrix filled empty values, - common network analysis want record self-references, make sense (alhough cases useful).as_adj() function also works.get edgelist, can use as_edgelist() function, returns table two columns.

Using class() confirms object’s type (“igraph”, see also suitable applications), str() reveals internal structure, includes slots edges, nodes, attributes. specialized class (list vectors, fact) designed efficient network computations.Next, use aforementioned asDF() function deconstruct network object two standard data frames: one edges one nodes. can re-assemble data frames new igraph object using graph_from_data_frame() function igraph.critical argument graph_from_data_frame() “vertices=”, allows provide nodelist, ensuring node attributes correctly reinstated new network object:can directly access sets edges vertices within network using E() V() functions, respectively. functions primarily used assign query attributes associated network’s elements. example, syntax {r}V(g)$attribute <- values standard way add new vertex attribute network “g”. next chunk, assign random values “strength” attribute:command plot() generates basic network visualization. uses “igraph”’s default settings render graph, provides quick, unmodified view network structure. useful immediate visual inspection offers customization. output always includes node labels layout determined built-algorithm.

Вып. 1–3). Узлами сети выступают посвященные персоналиям статьи словаря, а ребрами – ссылки на другие статьи в том же словаре. Такая сеть позволяет проследить ключевые тенденции в социальном и интеллектуальном взаимодействии литераторов XVIII века.По словам составителей: «В биографиях лиц, вошедших в историю гуманитарной культуры в качестве государственных деятелей, церковных и светских ораторов, ученых (экономистов, географов, правоведов, историков, лингвистов и пр.), издателей журналов и газет, публицистов, составителей сборников литературного содержания и вместе с тем попадающих в “Словарь”, выделяются и рассматриваются прежде всего сочинения, так или иначе повлиявшие на развитие художественной литературы» (Словарь русских писателей XVIII века. Принципы составления. Словник / сост. В. П. Степанов. Л.: Наука, 1975. С. 11).
