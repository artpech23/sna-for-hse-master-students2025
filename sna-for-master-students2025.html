<em>last update:</em> 2025-11-24</p>
<p>The network metaphor has become a prevalent part of contemporary societies. Ideas that have been developed in the social sciences over decades are now widely accepted by the general public. We frequently discuss the importance of “networking”, someone’s “connections”, or “social capital”. The daily presence of social media platforms (e.g., Telegram, VK, Twitter) in our lives – where we observe others’ numbers of friends and are often surprised when two seemingly distant acquaintances turn out to be connected – makes the subject of this course self-evident on the surface. However, the social network analysis (SNA) is much more than just a common metaphor; it is a powerful and well-formalized set of methods used to study complex real-world phenomena, from the spread of rumors or diseases (as seen recently with COVID-19) to global trade networks and the rise and fall of creativity in cultural industries.</p>
<p>SNA is an analysis-heavy subfield, meaning (1) it is challenging to come up with a general theory of social networks due to their diversity and complexity (viewing social reality relationally is one of the few unifying principles), and (2) it is difficult to grasp without hands-on experience with data. For these reasons, this course will focus on teaching you (1) how to develop researchable ideas and (2) how to test these ideas using available statistical software. The general goal of this course is thus to provide participants with essential insights into social networks and to equip them with the skills to analyze networks computationally.</p>

<p>This is the second time I teach networks at the master program “Data Analytics for Business and Economics” (Higher School of Economics, St. Petersburg). The last-year course page at HSE website is available <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/data-analytics/courses/904345939.html" style="color: #0000EE;">here</a>. The organization and structure of this course have been heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/courses/339501077" style="color: #0000EE;">Maria Safonova eponymous lectures</a> I took some years ago. In developing the course, I also consulted the syllabi created by Nadya Sokolova (2023, delivered at Eurpean University at St. Petersburg), <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/jlmartin/Syllabus%20for%20social%20networks%20290.pdf" style="color: #0000EE;">John Levi Martin (2008)</a>, <a href="https://sociology.rutgers.edu/images/syllabi/573_Social_Networks_Analysis_S2021.pdf" style="color: #0000EE;">Paul McLean (2021)</a>, Mark Mizruchi (2008), <a href="https://www.sociology.utoronto.ca/sites/sociology.utoronto.ca/files/SOC6108-2022-C.-Smith.pdf" style="color: #0000EE;">Chris Smith (2022)</a>, and <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/mb814/schedule.htm" style="color: #0000EE;">Steve Borgatti (2004)</a>.</p>

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

</div>
<div id="formalities" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered"><strong>Formalities</strong></h1>
<p>The course consists of six meetings held on Mondays or Tuesdays (depending on your study group, check the schedule <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/ma/data-analytics/timetable?fromdate=2025.10.27&amp;todate=2025.11.01&amp;groupoid=41180&amp;receiverType=3&amp;timetable-courses=1&amp;timetable-groups=41180" style="color: #0000EE;">here</a>) at 18:10 on Kantemirovskaya. Each session includes a lecture followed by a practical coding workshop. Students are expected to attend classes, participate actively in discussions, and engage in coding activities. The content of the final meeting (on December 8th or 16th, the gap is due to the holiday on November 4th) is flexible and can be adjusted based on student requests.</p>
<p>Your mark for the course consists of:</p>
<p><strong>- homework assignments:</strong> 60% (5 assignments in total; the average of 3 highest scores)</p>
<p><strong>- final exam:</strong> 40% (individual or group project)</p>
<p>All assignments and projects should be submitted via email to ensure timely review and feedback. The sections below outline the details of both grading components.</p>
<div id="home-assignments" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Home assignments</strong></h2>
<p>There will be 5 homework assignments throughout the course, but only your best 3 scores will be used to calculate your final grade. This means you can choose to complete all the homework or just 3 without it affecting your final mark. For the homework component, I will simply average your 3 highest grades. However, I strongly recommend reviewing each assignment, as completing them will better prepare you for the final project.</p>
<p>Homework assignments are due before the start of the next class (<strong>the exact time is 18:10, either Monday or Tuesday,</strong> each week). If you submit an assignment within the following week, you can still earn up to 8 points.</p>
</div>
<div id="exam" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Exam</strong></h2>
<p>The exam can be completed either individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Your task is to conduct a small research project and report your findings in a paper of approximately 4–5 pages (including visualizations, tables, and bibliography). These length guidelines are flexible, so feel free to write more or less if needed. The exam will consist of the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>1. Collect network data</strong></p>
<p>You are free to choose your context — whether it’s networks of friends, Hollywood actors, or another topic of interest. If you are working individually, you may use pre-existing datasets from GitHub or other data archives. However, ensure you don’t simply copy someone else’s work entirely. Replicating a study (without access to the original code) can be a good approach, though. I would not decrease the mark for analyzing already collected data, though you can get additional 2 points if you do collect the data yourself.</p>
<p><strong>2. Describe your data</strong></p>
<p>Provide a brief overview of your dataset and highlight its key aspects. Include a readable visualization of the network you are analyzing and compute and discuss its descriptive properties (e.g., density, diameter). Be sure to consider the context of your data: how ties are formed, how actors are selected, and any other relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>3. Pose research questions</strong></p>
<p>Formulate 2–3 research questions (preferably interconnected) and explain why these questions are important. If you have any hypothesEs and supporting literature, include them in your report. Note that a larger team need either more questions or questions which are difficult to work with alone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Describe your workflow</strong></p>
<p>Discuss the materials you consulted, any ideas that came to you during the course, and how long the analysis took. Include methodological considerations and reflections on the choices you made throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>5. Present and discuss the results</strong></p>
<p>Present your findings — for example, this could be in the form of a table with network values. However, it is important to also provide interpretations of these results, explaining what they mean in the context of your research.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to explore and experiment with the tools, as the goal is to learn through hands-on experience. Feel free to change the structure (e.g., data collection and description, research questions, methodology/inspiration/etc., results) if you feel it does not align with the type of work you are doing. The project format is flexible to suit different research interests and approaches.</p>
<p>In an ideal scenario, you should start thinking about your final project around the second meeting. Having ideas early will allow you to benefit more from class discussions and ask questions that specifically relate to your project.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the exam is to assess whether you are familiar with the basic logic of network analysis and whether you can apply some of the methods covered in the course. While the quality of your analysis is important, the focus will also be on your effort, reflection, and interpretation. Even if your technical analysis is not perfect, what matters most is your understanding of the principles of network analysis and your ability to critically reflect on your process. Network analysis can be challenging, and working with real data often presents unexpected difficulties, so the evaluation will not be overly strict. <strong>The deadline for the exam report is 19th December (by the end of the day) for both groups.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> last year some students decided to present their work during the last seminar, and I freed from writing this report (they got their exam marks for their in-class presentation). If there would be any volunteers, we can arrange similar activities during the final sessions this year.</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Evaluation</strong></h2>
<p>The following grading criteria apply to both homework assignments and the final exam:</p>
<p><strong>- “Excellent” (9–10)</strong></p>
<p>The student demonstrates deep knowledge and advanced skills, exceeding the materials discussed in the class and/or incorporating additional relevant resources. Coding procedures are thoroughly commented on, all tasks are completed without errors, and the work is properly structured.</p>
<p><strong>- “Excellent” (8)</strong></p>
<p>The student shows a strong understanding of the topic. While minor mistakes may be present, they do not significantly affect the results or interpretations. The work is well-structured and includes detailed explanations of the analytical procedures.</p>
<p><strong>- “Good” (6–7)</strong></p>
<p>The student responds correctly to most tasks but may provide some misleading interpretations and/or occasional errors that affect the results and interpretations. The work is clearly structured with appropriate comments.</p>
<p><strong>- “Satisfactory” (4–5)</strong></p>
<p>The student addresses about half of the assigned tasks and/or makes significant errors. Results and interpretations lack depth, and the work is not detailed enough to fully explain the analysis. Formatting is unclear.</p>
<p><strong>- “Fail” (0–3)</strong></p>
<p>The student fails to demonstrate knowledge of the relevant topics. Most tasks are either incorrect or not completed, and interpretations are brief or missing, with little to no reference to appropriate concepts or methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="extensions-and-late-submissions" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Extensions and late submissions</strong></h2>
<p>If you are unable to submit a homework assignment or take the exam on time due to a valid reason (e.g., illness, conference participation, or other extenuating circumstances), please notify me as soon as possible. You may receive up to 2 additional weeks to submit a homework assignment after the general deadline, and up to 1 additional week to complete the exam.</p>
<p>Documentation (e.g., a medical certificate) is required to confirm the reason for the delay. Please ensure to communicate any issues before the deadline whenever possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="software-requirements" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Software requirements</strong></h2>
<p>The primary tool for this course will be R and RStudio. R offers excellent packages for social network analysis, and it arguably provides better coverage of these methods compared to Python. I will guide you through learning how to effectively use these packages.</p>
<p>While R is powerful for analysis, it’s not the most intuitive tool for producing network visualizations. Due to that, we will explore <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> during our third meeting, as it is a highly effective tool for vizualization. Additionally, I encourage you to explore online tools like <a href="https://cosmograph.app/">Cosmograph</a> and <a href="https://graphcommons.com/">GraphCommons</a> for inspiration; these platforms also allow you to create visually appealing graphs.</p>

<p>The notes below accompany the first lecture of the course. It might be a good idea to consult the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oyyUwEo9PstlD5-2DGyFILB-6poT0IdSI2AG3y592OU/edit?usp=drive_link" style="color: blue;">lecture slides</a> as well, as some technical details and examples are discussed there.</p>
<p>During today’s meeting we are going to cover the very basics of doing network analysis in R. Relying on commonly used <code>igraph</code> package for data manipulation, we would learn about typical network data formats (edgelists, nodelists, and matrices) and how to convert them to (and from) typical tabular formats, and ways to manipulate and refer to edges and nodes of the constructed networks. We will also make our first attempts at analysis of the two exemplar datasets. After this session, you will be prepared for more concrete discussions of the network-related topics.</p>
<div id="libraries" class="section level2 unnumbered">

<div id="common-data-structures-and-procedures" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Common data structures and procedures</strong></h2>
<p>Networks are typically represented using two primary data formats. The first is an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong>, a square matrix where rows and columns represent nodes, and the cell values indicate the presence or weight of a tie between them. The second common format is an <strong>edgelist</strong>, which is a simple two-column list recording each connection as a pair of node identifiers. Often, an edgelist is accompanied by a separate <strong>nodelist</strong> that contains additional attributes for each node, such as names, gender, age, affiliations, etc. Matrices are efficient for dense, small networks and mathematical operations, while edgelists are more intuitive and memory-efficient for storing large, sparse networks. Altough we would not use matrices a lot, it is still important to think of such representations of your data during our further workshops (e.g., when we would discuss blockmodels).</p>
<p>Below is an image of the network obtained from Zachary’s (1977) study (we will get to constructing such network objects and visualizations later, for now it is useful just to see this image). Here is the data description as given in the <code>manynet</code> package:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network was observed in a university Karate club in 1977. The network describes association patterns among 34 members and maps out allegiance patterns between members and either Mr. Hi, the instructor, or the John A. the club president after an argument about hiking the price for lessons. The allegiance of each node is listed in the obc argument which takes the value 1 if the individual sided with Mr. Hi after the fight and 2 if the individual sided with John A.</p>

<p>Now, let’s look at the ways of representing this data. The <code>igraph</code> package provides simple functions to convert its network objects into standard data formats. You can transform a network to a matrix using the <code>as_adjacency_matrix()</code> function, which will create a square matrix representation. Each row/column here represents the person who sends the ties to the others (ties either exist, 1, or not, 0). Note that the diagonal of these matrix is filled with empty values, - it is common for network analysis that we do not want to record self-references, as they do not make sense (alhough there are cases when it is useful).</p>
<p>The <code>as_adj()</code> function also works.</p>

<p>For the nodelist, <code>igraph</code> is of little help, as it does not have a function for retreiving the data in this format. Though, we can use the function <code>as_nodelist()</code> from the <code>manynet</code> package. The “name” attribute corresponds to the ids of your nodes from the edgelist, and the “allegiance” is the only additional attribute associated with the nodes.</p>

<p>Another package that allows converting existing “igraph” objects to tabular data formats is <code>intergraph</code>. It is achieved via function <code>asDF()</code> - the function returns two objects, an edgelist and a nodelist. You can refer to them using $ sign after the function.</p>

<p>Network objects in <code>igraph</code> are complex data structures that encapsulate all network information. In the chunk below, we save the network as an object in our working environment (and call it “karate”). Using <code>class()</code> confirms the object’s type (“igraph”, but you see that it is also suitable for other applications), while <code>str()</code> reveals its internal structure, which includes slots for edges, nodes, and their attributes. This specialized class (a list of vectors, in fact) is designed for efficient network computations.</p>

<p>You can directly access the sets of edges and vertices within a network using the <code>E()</code> and <code>V()</code> functions, respectively. These functions are primarily used to assign or query attributes associated with the network’s elements. For example, the syntax <code>{r}V(g)$attribute &lt;- values</code> is the standard way to add a new vertex attribute to a network “g”. In the next chunk, we assign random values to the “strength” attribute:</p>

<p>The command <code>plot()</code> generates the most basic network visualization. It uses “igraph”’s default settings to render the graph, which provides a quick, unmodified view of the network structure. This is useful for an immediate visual inspection but offers no customization. The output always includes node labels and a layout determined by a built-in algorithm. Note that for large network objects, I might take time to draw such pictures, and it is probably recommended to move to specialized packages or softwares like Gephi (we would talk about it specifically and network visualizations in general during our third meeting).</p>

<p><img src="chapter1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The next piece of code demonstrates how to customize the plot by overriding default arguments within the <code>plot()</code> function. Here, node labels are removed (“vertex.label = NA”), and all nodes are given a uniform color (via “vertex.color”) and size (via “vertex.size”). In my opinion, even these changes improve on the previous viz a lot.</p>

<p><img src="chapter1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can proceed to even more complex request to <code>plot()</code> function, and refer to nodes’ (or edges!) attributes which are already “in” our “igraph” object. The syntax is somewhat bizarre, but you will get used to it. The idea is to use <code>V()</code> and <code>E()</code> functions to refer to either vertices (nodes) or edges from a given network, and then, using $ sign, refer to specific attributes. In the code below, the node size is scaled based on the “strength” attribute (we randomly assigned these values earlier), and node color is conditionally assigned based on the “allegiance” attribute.</p>
<p>Visualizations are super important in network analysis. This steps transform the plot from a simple structural diagram into a rich visual analysis tool.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an attribute which is not random and derived exactly from network structure. This code calculates the so called degree centrality, a measure which counts the number of connections each node has (we will cover this in more details next time). The <code>degree()</code> function from <code>igraph</code> computes this, and the result is stored directly as a new vertex attribute (<code>V(karate)$degree</code>), permanently attaching this metric to each node in the network object:</p>

<p>We now can work with these values in a more typical way. For example, we can plot a histogram of the degree values, which reveals the overall connectivity pattern within the network. This sort of visualizations shows the frequency of different degree levels, allowing you to see if the network is centralized around a few highly connected nodes or if connections are more evenly distributed among the participants. The former is the case for our network.</p>

<p>Given this visualization and two leading degree figures in the “allegiance” groups, it seems to be indeed a story about two confronting groups of actors consolidating about Mr. Hi and John A.</p>
<p>The next section repeats what we’ve done already, and shows you how to work with different sorts of connections.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Working through another example</strong></h2>
<p>In the most common scenario, we make some calculations on networks (calculate degrees, determine the community structure, etc.) and then get these values as a data frame suitable for the further analysis (basic statistics, distributions, regressions, and so on).</p>
<p>In the following code, I shortly illustrate this flow using the data from Lazega (2001). Here is the data description as given in the <code>manynet</code> package:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One-mode network dataset collected by Lazega (2001) on the relations between partners in a corporate law firm called SG&amp;R in New England 1988-1991. This particular subset includes the 36 partners among the 71 attorneys of this firm. Nodal attributes include seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool they attended, their age, and how many years they had been at the firm.</p>

<p>As you can see, the laoded object is already a network. Note how the data is structured:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>in total, there are 71 nodes and 2571 edges. It should be noted that the network as it is now combines multiple types of ties (during the class we discussed that it is not a good idea), though we should be careful with interpreting the output like this.</p></li>
<li><p>vertex attributes (there are many of them),</p></li>
<li><p>edges are also differentiated (this is the only edge attribute; it is the only “attr” containing “(e/c)” caption),</p></li>
<li><p>the ties are directed and unweighted, - so, people in the network might have chosen each other asymetrically, but all the ties were treated equally.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below, we dissolve this network into nodelist and edgelist just to recreate the graph again. This procedure is for the learning purposes only: I want to remind you how (1) to get nodelist/edgelist from the “igraph” object and (2) to create it using these same types of data.</p>

<p>Let’s now split the existing network into multiple networks with the respective types of ties. First, here are these types (we can take a look at them, as we already have the edgelist):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" tabindex="-1"></a>edgelist <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

<p>This result is already telling: there are twice more coworking ties among the studied colleagues than friendship ties. Next, we can create separate networks for each type of ties:</p>

<p>Note the naming for the “igraph” objects: it usually (in tutorials from online, for example) use “g” for graphs = networks. In our case, we also differentiate using the ties used in them.</p>
<p>Now it is legitimate to build these networks - once again, we do not want to mix the ties in our analysis to be sure about the real micro-/macro- consequences of the particular types of ties. So, let’s look at these networks.</p>
<p>One fancy procedure is done here that we did not cover yet - to plot the networks, I calculate the network centralities for all the nodes in each network. Degree centrality is the number of ties a node has; in the context of directred networks it might specifically calculate incoming our outgoing ties. Here, we calculate the incoming degree centrality, i.e. the number of ties a node receive.</p>
<p>Also, to make the pictures more interesting and remind you the way to use node attributes, I color the nodes using the <code>office</code> variable from the nodelist.</p>

<p>Although the pictures are useful &amp; engaging, some articles on networks do not include them at all. In our case, they provide little insight to the actual differences among the networks. To finish this set of analysis, we will just return to the nodelists once again and compare the average numbers of degrees across the offices (mean highest degree centralities).</p>

<p>It is hard to interpret the table straightforwardly as far as the different numbers of people are involved in each office. Still, we see that the average degree values are higher for Boston than Hartford, and Providence employees are excluded from the friendship network almost entirely. Sad but not that surprising given their office size.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can calculate the more specific stories, like the average number of people who ask women employees for advice. It is interesting that females are not discriminated (in this pure basic mathematical metrics) in friendship network:</p>

<p>You are now familiar with a basic network analysis routine as it looks in R. Keep in mind (1) data formats: matrices and edgelists/nodelists, as well as conversions from one format to another, and (2) the possibilities of “regular” descriptive/statistical work with the indicators derived from your networks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Definitions of centrality measures &amp; how to calculate them</strong></h2>
<p>Although there is <a href="http://www.centiserver.org/" style="color: blue;">a large variety of centrality measures out there</a>, today we will focus on 4 core measures we have covered in class. These are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>degree centrality,</p></li>
<li><p>betweenness centrality,</p></li>
<li><p>closeness centrality,</p></li>
<li><p>eigenvector centrality.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The definitions are embedded in the following text as well.</p>
<p>The picture below borrowed form <a href="https://bookdown.org/jdholster1/idsr/network-analysis.html" style="color: blue;">here</a> summarizes the differences between these measures:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://bookdown.org/jdholster1/idsr/Centrality.png" />
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the last seminar, we worked with 3 types of relations among lawyers. Below, I illustrate all 4 centrality measures on these graphs. The next section covers a potentially interesting source of bibliometric (thus network) data and applications of today’s material to its analysis.</p>
<p>First, we need to load the libraries:</p>

<p>Now, we can calculate the centrality measures.</p>
<p><strong>Degree centrality</strong> stands for the number of ties that involve a given node. It is particularly meaningful for identifying popular or well-connected actors. There are various adjustments to this simple definition depending on the type of edges in your network:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>total degree centrality (for undirected networks),</p></li>
<li><p>in-degree and out-degree centrality (for directed networks, the sum of received and sent ties respectively),</p></li>
<li><p>weighted degree centrality (the sum of weights of the involved ties; can be applied to the directed networks as well).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, as we are dealing with directed networks (ties are not necessary symmetric), we would calculate (1) in-degree and (2) out-degree centrality values. For educational purposes, I also compute (3) total degree.</p>
<p>The type of measure you want to get is specified via “mode” argument in <code>degree()</code> function from <code>igraph</code> package. The computations in the chunk below are done for all 3 networks.</p>
<p>For weighted degree centrality, use <code>strength()</code> function from <code>igraph</code>.</p>

<p>Next, let’s calculate the <strong>closeness centrality</strong>, i.e. the length of the average shortest path between a node and all other nodes in the network. In other words, it measures how quickly a node can reach all other nodes in the network. It can be valuable for identifying nodes that can rapidly disseminate information, like central offices in corporate structures.</p>
<p>Note that <code>igraph</code> offers you the normalized and inverted values, so, we need to interpret those values as the inverse of the mean distance of each node to all other nodes that the focal node can reach.
Also, in directed graphs, we need to specify the <code>mode = "out"</code> argument to get the desired values.</p>
<p>Isolates are assigned an NA value.</p>

<p>In the table above, I have filtered the data to show the lawyers with the largest values of closeness centrality. These people have extreme values of total degree centrality, so, it is relatively easy for these people to get to others.</p>
<p>Finally, here are the computations for <strong>betweenness centrality</strong> and <strong>eigenvector centrality</strong>. The former measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes, indicating its potential for controlling information flow. Calculated with <code>igraph::betweenness()</code>, it identifies bridges or brokers in networks (e.g., think of transportation hubs or third parties managing negotiations). The eigenvector centrality, instead, assesses a node’s influence based on both its connections and the importance of those connections, capturing the concept that connecting to well-connected others benefits one’s needs. Notice that for <code>igraph::eigen_centrality()</code> we need to refer to <code>vector</code> element from the output to get the values.</p>

<p>Though the majority of actors occur in both lists (26, 22, 24, 16, 19, 15, 17, 28, 31), there node “13” seems to possess some gatekeeping potential. Finally, we can visualize these networks.</p>
<p>To avoid dealing with arrows, I convert the networks to undirected mode (this procedure is purely for plotting purposes).</p>

<p>We can see here that betweenness centrality is a way more discriminating measure: most of the nodes in this network do not occur on the shortest paths between other nodes very often. In the network with size equal to degree centrality, we can see that the distribution is less severe.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Working through bibliometric example from OpenAlex data</strong></h2>
<p>As the topic of centrality measures is relatively straightforward, I thought it might be of some interest for you if we pick a bibliometric database for the next example, so that you would (1) get your hands on freely available scientific literature metadata, suggested by <a href="https://openalex.org/" style="color: blue;">OpenAlex project</a>, and (2) relate the ideas on centrality to bibliometric analysis. Though there are many options for the literature search nowadays, ranging from simplistic google.scholar search field to the fancy AI-tools, it might be a good idea in concrete scenarios to study the literature formally with network analysis tools. It mostly applies to clustering / community detection techniques, which we are going to covert next week, but nothing prevents us from computing centrality measures on this sorts of data as well. Obviously, there are many specialized programs developed specifically for science mapping / literature reviews (e.g. <a href="https://www.vosviewer.com/" style="color: blue;">VOSviewer</a>, <a href="https://www.citnetexplorer.nl/" style="color: blue;">CitNetExplorer</a>, etc.), but loading, cleaning, and exploring the entire subset of literature you are interested in from R can be useful.</p>
<p>Currently, it is hard to access Scopus/Web of Science data (these are commonly used sources of data for scientometric studies) from Russia due to restrictions from these companies (although you still can get some metadata if you create <a href="https://dev.elsevier.com/" style="color: blue;">an API key for Scopus</a> and utilize tools like <code>rscopus</code> package (read documentation <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rscopus/rscopus.pdf" style="color: blue;">here</a>), - but, remember, the output would be limited, and the speed/limits are present for this option). For this reason, we would rely on OpenAlex, - a comprehensive, freely accessible database of the global scholarly system, including millions of journal articles, authors, institutions, and research concepts. Its major advantage is that it provides a straightforward way to access and analyze citation networks and research trends for free, making it ideal for bibliometric analysis.</p>
<p>For our ease, there is a wonderful package called <code>openalexR</code> (<a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/index.html" style="color: blue;">documentation</a>). If you are interested in the topic, you can dive into <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/articles/Filters.html" style="color: blue;">the filters’ specifications</a>, or just follow the example suggested below. To put this simply, we need to make a search query by using multiple arguments of the function <code>oa_fetch()</code>, check whether we are satisfied with the output lengths, adjust our request if needed, and finally download the data.</p>
<p>For example, we can search for the “works” (papers, books, reviews, etc.) that contain the phrase “Sustainable Business Models” in their titles, and request just the overall number of found publications by setting the “count_only” argument to TRUE:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb37-1"><a href="#cb37-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">oa_fetch</span>(<span class="at">entity =</span> <span class="st">&quot;works&quot;</span>,</span>

<p>The output means that there are almost 4 thousands of works related to our query in OpenAlex. Let’s reduce this number by setting the “cited_by_count” argument to be more than 10, meaning that only works cited more than 10 times would be returned. It is our data for this demonstration.</p>

<p>The returned data frame contains 897 rows (articles, books, etc.) and 38 columns (data on our works, ranging from titles and publication years to cited references, which is of primary interest to us as network analysts). Below is the complete list of variables exported from OpenAlex:</p>

<p>It seems that the topic is on the rise since the mid-2010s. Let’s construct now a citation network from these sources. To do that, we need to work with “referenced_works” column, which basically lists sources referenced by a given work. Surely, it might not be ideal for all works (e.g., Russian sources are often poorly represented (in terms of metadata) in OpenAlex), but it should be fine for our purposes.</p>
<p>We start by getting an edgelist of citations. Note that we limit our sample to just those works covered by our search query, meaning that “cited_by_count” values (number of documents citing a work) should not match the in-degree centrality values that we are going to compute. To exclude all external (not from our sample) works, we can filter the “referenced_works” by “id” column:</p>

<p>As you can see from this image, there is no single network, - instead, there are some isolated groups of nodes, with one of these sub-networks including a large proportion of networks’ nodes. These sub-networks are called “components”. We can get info on the number of components in an igraph object with <code>components()</code> function:</p>

<p>This output means that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>there are 724 nodes in our network (this number is below number of rows in “oa_sustainable”, the data frame we got from OpenAlex, due to missing values in “referenced_works” column, and the removal of nodes that do not link to other nodes in our literature base),</p></li>
<li><p>there are 14 components (clusters, sub-graphs, etc.) in our network, with the largest of them including 699 nodes (thus being 96.5% of network nodes).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A usual procedure in such cases in network analysis is to describe the network structure (number of small components, the distribution of nodes among them) and continue by analyzing the largest component in details. Before doing this, we can assign membership attribute to our nodes and plot these sub-networks separately:</p>

<p>The combination of network data with the attributes of the works allows to analyze how the field developed. The picture below shows the same dynamics of yearly publications as before, but it also indicates how published works were cited in this scientific domain. Note that it is different from “cited_by_count” variable, which accounts for the entire referencing (beyond publications falling in our query). When the volume of publications got large enough (and some of them got many citations), “review” appeared as a genre which can accumulate citations as well.</p>

<p>The very high correlation (0.88, p-value &lt; 0.01) between in-degree centrality and cited_by_count is expected because they are essentially measuring the same thing: in-degree is the local citation count within our specific network. This result is expected.</p>
<p>The moderate correlation for eigenvector centrality (0.66, p-value &lt; 0.01) indicates that citations from well-connected, influential papers (rather than just numerous papers) provides an additional, independent boost to a work’s total impact. The lower correlation for betweenness (0.56, p-value &lt; 0.01) suggests that while acting as a bridge between research communities can bring some recognition, it is a less direct driver of high citation counts than simply being frequently cited. Finally, the near-zero correlation for closeness (0.13, p-value &lt; 0.01) is common in citation networks; the speed at which a paper can reach others in the network is largely irrelevant—what matters is whether others actually cite it. The relevance of this score is also disrupted by the directed nature of our network.</p>
<p>By relying on centrality measures, we can differentiate locally and globally central nodes (works) and gatekeeping works, here meaning works connecting different topics / lines of research.</p>

<p>You need to select a network dataset you like (check <a href="#available-datasets"><strong>Available datasets</strong></a>) and analyze the most central nodes in it. To do that,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>come up with 2-3 hypotheses about the central actors,</p></li>
<li><p>match them with the certain centrality measures we discussed in class (types of degree centrality, betweenness, etc.),</p></li>
<li><p>present and discuss the results the way you think is relevant. For example, you can draw the network highlighting the central nodes or present a table with various centrality scores (do not insert very large tables, include the nodes with the max./min. values or those nodes you think are important). Preferably, your hypotheses should include nodes’ variables not related to the network itself (gender, age, office, etc.). In the latter case, you can continue with distributions, scatterplots, or summary statistics table and simple regression modeling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever analysis flow you choose, reflect on your steps, results, and difficulties in text. The work can be sumbitted in word/pdf/html format (just copy tables / visualizations in the first two scenarios and comment on them).</p>
<p>If you want to revisit some theory, you can check the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXohUeNCJiU&amp;list=PL2rR6Wa-StjYOW7v6J8_npck6EDOKEbCN&amp;index=7&amp;t=2s&amp;pp=iAQB0gcJCQMKAYcqIYzv" style="color: blue;">lecture by Lada Adamic</a> or <a href="https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/ch9-Network-Centrality-Hierarchy-R.html" style="color: blue;">this</a> or <a href="https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/ch9-Network-Centrality-Hierarchy-R.html" style="color: blue;">that</a> pages (with R!).</p>

<p>The notes below accompany the third lecture of the course. It might be a good idea to consult the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ff0JjV7v2tNI3oCqFgGmMtGzkmFk2cpGZumOudxm2MM/edit?usp=sharing">lecture slides</a> as well, as some technical details and examples are discussed there. During this session, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>take a look at graph-level characheristics of the networks,</p></li>
<li><p>community detection algorithms,</p></li>
<li><p>and learn how to export network data to environments outside R and visualize it. The final section of this page contains notes on sources (we would cover <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>, <a href="https://graphcommons.com/">GraphCommons</a>, and <a href="https://cosmograph.app/">Cosmograph</a>) and code to prepare your data for the export (mainly, column renaming).</p></li>

<p>For this time, we once again will analyze the lawfirm studied by Lazega (2001) available from <code>manynet</code> package. I stack to this example, because it is already familiar to you. Towards the end of this class, we will take a look at other networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One-mode network dataset collected by Lazega (2001) on the relations between partners in a corporate law firm called SG&amp;R in New England 1988-1991. This particular subset includes the 36 partners among the 71 attorneys of this firm. Nodal attributes include seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool they attended, their age, and how many years they had been at the firm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, we load data and split the network into 3 separate networks devoted to the special types of ties:</p>

<p>First, we cover the basic measures to describe the networks.</p>
<p>To explain the diameter measure, I shortly return to <code>karateka</code> network from <code>manynet</code> package to highlight what the measures compute.</p>

<p><strong>Diameter</strong> is the largest shortest path in the network, the approximate measure of the network’s size. It can be computed with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb54-1"><a href="#cb54-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">get_diameter</span>(karate)</span>

<p>And here is a summary table for the types of networks from the <code>lawfirm</code> network. Note the difference between the “cowork” and “friends” networks: the former has a shorter diameter, meaning (1) it is easier for ideas to travel there, (2) this network has more edges in general, so we should interpret the results carefully.</p>

<p>Next, let’s discuss centralization and density.</p>
<p><strong>Centralization</strong> - the measure of concentration of the network around the nodes with high values of degree centality.</p>
<p><strong>Density</strong> - number ob observed ties / number of possible ties. You can interpret it directly, as the measure of number of relations present in the network. Note the maths here: The maximum number of possible edges in a graph can be calculated using the formula <span class="math inline">\(E_{max} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> represents the number of nodes in the network.</p>
<p>The table below shows these values for our networks:</p>

<p>Next,</p>
<p><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - (for directed graphs only) the share of relations which are reciprocal, i.e. directed for both nodes involved.</p>
<p><strong>Transitivity</strong> - the density of loops of length three (triangles) in a network, or, in other words, a measure of the nodes’ tendency to cluster together.</p>
<p><strong>Homophily</strong> - tendency of the nodes to form ties with similar nodes (similar gender, age, etc.)</p>
<p>Let’s compute these measures for all of our networks (friendship, coworking, advice). For honophily, we check whether nodes tend to be tied to each other based on “gender” or “practice” attributes:</p>

<p>Another important note is that you can use different resolution parameters. Indirectly, it changes the number of communities detected. When applying the algorithm to your data, please, check the whole range of “resolution” values to see how robust your solutions are.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Case study: last week OpenAlex network</strong></h2>
<p>Last week we have discussed bibliographic networks you can obtain using OpenAlex, an open science source of articles’ metadata and citations’ information. Below is a brief illustration of today’s measures on this network:</p>

<p>To dive into the obtained clusters, we can group some attributes of the articles to see what’s hidden inside (note that we calculated the share of nodes associated with the “core” coming from each of the calculated communities. In some cases, it might be a good idea, if your communities coexist with the core/periphery structure, - we will cover one such example briefly next time):</p>

<p>Arguably, we need to adjust our searching query to obtain more meaningful communities, or to use different community detection techniques. At the end of the day, remember, <em>cohesion is easier to measure than to detect communities, and sometimes you do not need to do the latter</em>.</p>

<p>In this short tutorial, we’ll look at three datasets in Gephi (available via my github, see the code below, or the course folder) - all sent to you with this code in the archive. Below is a simple example of how to load them into R, analyze them, and save them back for analysis.</p>
<div id="insna" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered"><strong>insna</strong></h3>
<p>The first data set is <code>insna</code>, containing social scientists who studied networks in the 1970s. The data dates back to 1977 and includes information about who taught whom among the participants of the International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA). The data was collected by Barry Wellman, the founder of INSNA. Among the 60 participants in the network are Harrison White, Mark Granovetter, Ronald Burt, and Diane Crane.</p>
<p>This data can be obtained from the <code>networkdata</code> package (if you don’t have 5-7 minutes to spare, it’s best not to install this package - it’s very large).</p>

<p>To load lists of edges and nodes, Gephi requires special names for variables:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>in the edgelist</em>, the first columns should be named “Source” and “Target”,</p></li>
<li><p><em>in the nodelist</em>, the first columns should be named “Id” and “Label”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This allows Gephi to mark up the data and load everything correctly. In the code below I get the edgelist and nodelist and rename the first columns in them.</p>

<p>Although the authors of the dataset write that “data without preliminary processing can be loaded into programs for network analysis when solving educational problems”, it is still better to firstly observe the files in R to get acquainted with their organization, convert them into a format familiar for work, and calculate the statistics of interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Датасет представляет собой осмысленные в терминах сетевого анализа междустатейные ссылки в Словаре русских писателей XVIII века (1988–2010. Вып. 1–3). Узлами сети выступают посвященные персоналиям статьи словаря, а ребрами – ссылки на другие статьи в том же словаре. Такая сеть позволяет проследить ключевые тенденции в социальном и интеллектуальном взаимодействии литераторов XVIII века.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>По словам составителей: «В биографиях лиц, вошедших в историю гуманитарной культуры в качестве государственных деятелей, церковных и светских ораторов, ученых (экономистов, географов, правоведов, историков, лингвистов и пр.), издателей журналов и газет, публицистов, составителей сборников литературного содержания и вместе с тем попадающих в “Словарь”, выделяются и рассматриваются прежде всего сочинения, так или иначе повлиявшие на развитие художественной литературы» (Словарь русских писателей XVIII века. Принципы составления. Словник / сост. В. П. Степанов. Л.: Наука, 1975. С. 11). Таким образом, связи в построенной на данных Словаря сети отражают <em>взаимодействие агентов в поле русской литературы XVIII века.</em></p>

<p>If you want, you can also look in Gephi at the second dataset from the same authors, <code>foreign_EDGES.csv</code>, and compare it with the previous data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Узлами сети выступают русские писатели XVIII века, ребрами — общность их обращения к одним и тем же европейским литераторам. &lt;…&gt; Такая сеть позволяет
проследить ключевые тенденции в литературной моде XVIII века. Данные организованы в виде ненаправленного взвешенного графа. Вес ребра означает число общих для данных литераторов упоминаний европейских писателей.</p>

</ul>
<p>The data format needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>edgelist (“source”, “target”) - it is already enough to build the graph, though you can also add columns “time” and “value”</p></li>
<li><p>nodelist = metadata file (“id”, “color”, “size”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To put your hands on the program, you can load the files about the connections of Russian writers created above into the program: they are already in the appropriate format (source, target), and therefore no modifications are needed.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Home assignment 3</strong></h2>
<p>Choose a dataset you like ((check <a href="#available-datasets"><strong>Available datasets</strong></a>) or find a network by yourself), format it appropriately (lists of nodes and edges), and draw the network in Gephi or other software (Graph Commons, Cosmograph). Think about the story you want to tell by showing your network (specific nodes’ positions, network structure, etc.). Feel free to edit the picture using other softwares (if you struggle with captions in Gephi, for example, you can annotate your picture somewhere else).</p>
<p>Insert your graph to pdf/word and write 5-6 sentences about your thought process and story behind the image. Refer to network properties we discussed in class (diameter, homophily, core/peripherical structure) to support your arguments.</p>
<p>If you want to practice more, you can accompany your work with a short report about the most central nodes in the network and/or the structure of the network, including your interpretation of these results.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered"><strong>4 - two-mode networks</strong></h1>
<p>Two-mode networks, or bipartite networks, or affiliation networks (these are used interchangeably sometimes), consist of <strong>two distinct sets of nodes, where ties exist only between nodes of different sets</strong> (e.g., people and events, authors and papers). This structure is particularly useful for representing affiliations, co-occurrences, or memberships, while preserving the relationships between these categories. Unlike one-mode networks, analyzing two-mode networks requires specialized workflows and metrics to account for their unique structure. In this session, we will walk through the steps of construction, vizualization, and analysis of a two-mode network.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Basic example</strong></h2>
<p>The data for the first part of today’s session comes from the famous study conducted by Davis and his colleagues (1941). It represents attendance data from 14 social events hosted by 18 women in the American South during the 1930s. This bipartite network captures the <em>affiliations between women and events</em>, highlighting patterns of social interaction, group formation, and shared affiliations. It is a classical dataset to tell students about the two-mode network analysis.</p>
<p>This data is available via the <code>networkdata</code> package that you should already be aware of. Just in case, this same dataset is attached to the zip-folder I sent you, so, below I load it directly from this file.</p>

<p>By looking at this data structure, you should note several things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>types of nodes (women and events) are not differentiated when counting the number of nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is a nodes’ attribute “type” which specifies whether a node is an event or a women. When you create a graph with the two-mode organization by yourself, <code>igraph</code> would not recognize its special nature unless you provide this variable, “type”, in the nodes’ list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s try to plot this graph to get a better sense of two-mode networks:</p>

<p><code>igraph</code> includes some fancy network layouts which can look pretty when dealing with two-mode networks. These examples also show you how to excel at network visualizations in R:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>we remove nodes’ captions to simplify the picture,</p></li>
<li><p>we code the types of nodes using colors and shapes together,</p></li>
<li><p>we change layouts each time to see whether the network structure is presented intuitively clear,</p></li>
<li><p>finally, we add titles so that the layout applied is shown.</p></li>

<p>Probably, the core message in-scripted in these pictures is the presence of two types of nodes and the exclusive attachment of dissimilar nodes to each other. Again, these are the core features of the two-mode networks, and they bound the range of techniques we can apply to study this graph.</p>
<p>Theoretically, we have 3 options:</p>

<li><p>proceed as usual, and apply typical one-mode measures to the two-mode network</p></li>
<li><p>analyze each mode separately using two-mode metrics</p></li>
<li><p>convert the two-Mode network into two projections (i.e., a network of women and a network of events, where the ties correspond to the omitted type of nodes) and analyze them both as the usual one-mode networks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach involves treating the two-mode network as-is and applying standard metrics like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality directly to the bipartite structure. While familiar and straightforward, this strategy may overlook nuances specific to the two-mode context, as <em>many of these measures assume homogeneity among nodes</em>. For example, computing degree centrality can highlight which women attended the most events and which events had the highest participation, meanwhile writing these centrality values into a single column. This last obstacle can puzzle us once the networks get larger and some of the second-order nodes receive too many connections. To put shortly, the comparison of the centralities of these two types of nodes might be misleading. And <em>it gets worse with other measures</em>, and degree centrality, as the simpliest version of centrality, is an only real option to calculate (even with the difficulties just metioned).</p>

<p>The code from above computes the degree centrality scores (nothing new to you) and produce a table with the nodes of each class which possess the highest degree values. It should be interpreted as “Evelyn attended 8 events”, or “event on 16th of September was attended by 14 women (all who are present in the data attended it)”.</p>
<p>The second option we have is to apply metrics developed specifically for two-mode networks. They allow researchers to investigate each set of nodes individually while preserving their connections to the other set. For instance, bipartite density measures the proportion of possible ties in the network, while metrics like two-mode clustering coefficients examine how groups form across the sets. <strong>Analyzing modes separately ensures that the unique nature of bipartite ties is not lost.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, this line of the possible workflows is not currently well-developed for R. The only available reliable package we have at the moment is <code>tnet</code> developed by <a href="https://toreopsahl.com/">Tore Opsahl</a>. We would not cover it today (although, you can consult external sources on <code>tnet</code> or work in the other softwares, like Pajek, to work in this style).</p>
<p>The third option is the one we focus on below. It implies a common strategy to project the two-mode network onto one or both sets of nodes, resulting in one-mode networks. <strong>In the projection, nodes from one set are connected if they share a common neighbor in the other set.</strong> For example, women could be connected if they attended the same event, or events could be connected if they were attended by the same women. This approach facilitates the use of standard one-mode network analysis tools but <strong>risks introducing bias, as projections often inflate edge weights and lose important bipartite context.</strong> Careful interpretation is required to avoid overestimating connectivity.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get the projections is to multiply two-mode matrice to its transposed version (i.e., the matrix where rows become columns and columns become rows). This is a way to get one of the one-mode networks, or projections. Once we change the order of multiplication, we get the second desired one-mode network. The code below shows these steps in details:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Dimensionality reduction</strong></h2>
<p>Dimensionality Reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of variables or dimensions in a dataset while retaining as much meaningful information as possible. This is particularly useful in exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning when high-dimensional data becomes challenging to interpret or analyze.</p>
<p>Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a dimensionality reduction method designed for visualizing the relationships between rows and columns in a contingency table. By decomposing the chi-squared statistic of the table, it projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space, revealing patterns and associations. CA has a natural connection to the analysis of two-mode networks, as it provides a powerful framework for understanding relationships between two distinct sets of entities, much like bipartite networks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Clustering a two-mode network on cultural tastes and leisure activities</strong></h2>
<p>This data was collected by the group of sociology students who attended the course on “Culture and Inequality” during the spring of 2025. The goal here was to map the respondents’ perception of association between the jobs / professions and cultural preferences. The whole research strategy is inspired by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boltanski, L., &amp; Thévenot, L. (1983). Finding one’s way in social space: a study based on games. Social science information, 22(4-5), 631-680.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an on-going project, so it is just the slice of the data. Apologies that it is in Russian.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"><strong>Home assignment 4</strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to analyze the structure and relationships within a two-mode network, understand its properties, and derive meaningful conclusions based on the patterns observed. Choose a dataset you like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/corporate-interlocks-in-scotland-1904-5">Corporate interlocks in Scotland</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/hollywood-film-music">Hollywood film music</a></p></li>
<li><p>data you find/construct by your own (github, google, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Describe the network: who/what are the nodes? Vizualize it the way you prefer (in R or in Gephi, do not forget about different layouts possible). Select the mode of analysis: choose to work with either two-mode network or one-mode projections. In the second scenario, provide vizualizations of both projections. Discuss whether you want to work with one specific projection or not. Do the analysis you consider relevant: compute centrality measures, search for communities, core/periphery, etc.</p>
<p>Format: word/pdf/html. If you construct your document from R, make sure it is formatted nicely (no long outputs printed, etc.)
Deadline - before your next class.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered"><strong>Available datasets</strong></h1>
<p>Throughout the course I will do my best to illustrate network-related ideas using various sources of data, e.g. from organizational domains to pupils’ interactions and from well-known and “modal” (typically used in tutorials) to those found in recent academic and non-academic publications and collected by me. Still, for the exam project and 3 out of 4 home assignments which involve programming, you will need to pick a dataset to work with. The list below provides some basic sources of data which you can use for your investigations:</p>
<p>Other highly recommended platforms include GitHub and similar data-sharing sites (see the list below). Many enthusiasts collect and upload network data there, and sometimes these authors also provide accompanying learning materials.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R packages, like <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manynet/manynet.pdf" style="color: #0000EE;">“manynet”</a> and, especially, <a href="https://schochastics.github.io/networkdata/" style="color: #0000EE;">“networkdata”</a>, assemble many network datasets and provide easy access to them. Be aware that the “networkdata” package can take a while to install, as it includes nearly a thousand datasets. I recommend installing both, as I will sometimes use data from these libraries during practical sessions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/index.html" style="color: #0000EE;">The UCI Network Data Repository</a> is another wonderful source, where datasets are tagged by their subject and the phenomena they represent. Please note that some files may be in atypical formats, so you might need to convert them into an R-suitable format for your work.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets" style="color: #0000EE;">Datasets</a> provided by UCINET software developers are in Pajek format (these can be used in R with some manipulation), but you will likely find most of these networks in aforementioned “networkdata” package.</p></li>
<li><p>Other highly recommended platforms include github and similar data-sharing sites (see some more in the next list). Many enthusiasts collect and upload network data there, and sometimes these authors also provide accompanying learning materials, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyAlanSmith/Integrated_Network_Science/tree/master/data" style="color: #0000EE;">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, these sources do not cover the full variety of networks available. Here are some examples of datasets that previous generation of students has found on their own:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreagarritano/deezer-social-networks" style="color: #0000EE;">Networks of <em>Deezer</em> users in three countries</a>, available at kaggle.com</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://dracor.org/rus" style="color: #0000EE;">collection</a> of networks based on character interactions in Russian drama literature (similar collections are also available for other languages and literatures).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://dataverse.pushdom.ru/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.31860/openlit-2023.4-B003" style="color: #0000EE;">Russian-European literature connections of 18 century</a>, another literature-related source.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, remember that you can collect data yourself. During the course, I will show you examples of not-too-large datasets collected in seconds using the web-scraping techniques.</p>

<p>Although we have too little time to dive into the literature, you might want (or need) to consult some of the sources from below during the module. First, here are the technical guides which cover the basic concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rawlings, C. M., Smith, J. A., Moody, J., &amp; McFarland, D. A. (2023). Network analysis: integrating social network theory, method, and application with R. Cambridge University Press.
(on-line supplementary material is available <a href="https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/" style="color: #0000EE;">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Hanneman R. &amp; Riddle M. (2005) Introduction to Social Network Methods
(on-line book, available <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/index.html" style="color: #0000EE;">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Wasserman, S. &amp; Faust K. (1994) Social network analysis: Methods and applications. The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following list is a mixture of theoretical writings and empirical papers primarily from the field of sociology. It is also with some incline towards the sociology of science, as (1) the data on scientific activities is easily available for researchers and (2) I am interested in this subfield personally. When selecting from this list, consider both (1) the domain of inquiry (topics) that interests you and (2) the methods applied. The most exciting works (in my opinion) are marked in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<p>The visualization below captures all of these references and citations among them. In the end of the day, we are having a network science course, so why not thinking about the literature from bibliometric perspective. The data comes from <a href="https://openalex.org/" style="color: #0000EE;">OpenAlex</a>, and may be biased to some extent. The color of the nodes correspond to the literature sections on this page, and the nodes’ size is a number of incoming links (“indegree centrality”) as derived for this set of nodes (<em>81</em>). There are some isolated nodes, which you may see after zooming out.</p>
