# **Recommended literature** {-}


> *<font color="red">work-in-progress: (1) literature will be re-arranged more logically, (2) literature will be added, (3) maybe network viz of citation relations between these sources (?). </span>*



Although we have too little time to dive into the literature, you might want (or need) to consult some of the sources from below during the module. First, here are the technical guides which cover the basic concepts:


  -	Rawlings, C. M., Smith, J. A., Moody, J., & McFarland, D. A. (2023). Network analysis: integrating social network theory, method, and application with R. Cambridge University Press.
(on-line supplementary material is available [here](https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/){style="color: #0000EE;"})


  -	Hanneman R. & Riddle M. (2005) Introduction to Social Network Methods
(on-line book, available [here](https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/index.html){style="color: #0000EE;"})


  -	Wasserman, S. & Faust K. (1994) Social network analysis: Methods and applications. The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge.


Additionally, the following list is a mixture of theoretical writings and empirical papers primarily from the field of sociology. It is also with some incline towards the sociology of science, as (1) the data on scientific activities is easily available for researchers and (2) I am interested in this subfield personally. When selecting from this list, consider both (1) the domain of inquiry (topics) that interests you and (2) the methods applied. The most exciting works (in my opinion) are marked in **bold**.


Social network analysis is widely used in other social sciences. If you need recommendations on literature for your specific interests, feel free to reach out to me during class or via email, and I will do my best to provide you with relevant and essential papers for your research.
